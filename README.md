# About

This repository is for me to track and exercise my skills with algorithms and data structures. My goal is to produce at least one solution for each problem. This solution will usually be the simplest, other more optimal solutions I make are an effort to reduce the time and space complexities (generally one or the other).


# Directories

## Algorithms
This directory is for algorithm practice. Within are directories of various languages used to write the algorithms which contain exercises from LeetCode.
